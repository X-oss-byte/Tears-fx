# Overview of the AI Bot template

This template showcases a bot app that responds to user questions like an AI assistant. This enables your users to talk with the AI assistant in Teams to find information.

The app template is built using the Teams AI library, which provides the capabilities to build AI-based Teams applications.

## Get started with the AI Bot template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the AI Bot template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts)
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)
> - An account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) or [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) resource.

1. First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
1. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
1. In file *.localConfigs*, fill in your Open AI key `OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>`.
1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Teams using a web browser. Select `Debug (Edge)` or `Debug (Chrome)`.
1. When Teams launches in the browser, select the Add button in the dialog to install your app to Teams.
1. You will receive a welcome message from the bot, or send any message to get a response.

**Congratulations**! You are running an application that can now interact with users in Teams:
